# Hashtag-DnD Lite Edition
PLEASE SUPPORT the Original Creator: [Raeleus Hashtag-DnD](https://github.com/raeleus/Hashtag-DnD)

This Lite Edition has several goals:
1) Compatibility for other scripts (see the master branch for a raw compatibility version).
2) Create a lighter version of scripts (may have less features in exchange for compatibility, and enhancements).
3) Enhance commands, create dynamic systems, removing some restrictions.
4) Improve customisation for users via story cards.
5) Improve readability and simplify code for modders.
