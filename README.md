## A Scenario script for AI Dungeon<br>
Hashtag DnD is a scripted AI Dungeon scenario that gives you a variety of tools to enhance your adventure!
- Fully working inventory system, loot drops.
- Skill/Ability based gameplay guarantees a challenge at every turn.
- Unlimited party size with each character having their own inventory, stats, and skills.
- Multiplayer compatible.
- Personalized note system that does not take up context space.

## Lite Edition
The Lite Edition has several goals:
1) Create a more narative based game system.
2) Enhance commands, create dynamic systems, remove some restrictions.
3) Improve customisation for users/authors via story cards.

### Lite Edition is NOT Compatible with [The Original Hashtag-DnD by Raeleus](https://github.com/raeleus/Hashtag-DnD)!

If you think you may want the full set of features offered by [The Original Hashtag-DnD by Raeleus](https://github.com/raeleus/Hashtag-DnD), then please us that. You will not be able to upgrade later!

Lite Edition does not have all the features of [The Original Hashtag-DnD by Raeleus](https://github.com/raeleus/Hashtag-DnD); and a lot of commands, and features have been trimmed out in exchange for lighter systems that are more customisable.
